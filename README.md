# SBLGNT Parser

## A parser for the [SBL Greek New Testament](https://github.com/morphgnt/sblgnt)

This package provides a parser and tools for the [SBL Greek New Testament](https://github.com/morphgnt/sblgnt) format.

## Technical Information

Currently only Python 3.4+ is supported because the package uses the new [pathlib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html). Maybe I will change this in order to support all versions of python including [pypy](http://pypy.org/).
